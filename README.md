# Fanboi üå¨üñ•Ô∏èüå°Ô∏è
A linux PID controller for fans.

## What is This?
I simple fan controller I wrote for fun for my [rockpro64](https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64). While maxing out all six cores with a tall heatsink, the controller seems to settle on a pwm value of 121 and a temperature of 61¬∞C. With the default target temperature value being 40¬∞C, at idle the fan doesn't even run. I'm not sure how it would work on other boards. Those have yet to be tested. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Features
- Runs as a systemd service.
- Tuneable PID controller.

```

## Docker
Comes with a nix config for generating a minimalist docker image.
```
nix-build docker.nix && docker load -i ./result
```

## Development
If you use Nix, the `shell.nix` config will give you a development environment:
```
nix-shell
```

Otherwise, if you're on anything else:
```
cargo build
```
